# BucketList Generator

## Description


The motivation behind building this application was the desire to create something for users who are stuck in the rut of life and need some inspiration to break out of their daily routine. The bucketlist generator is a unique app that can spark the users imagination and drive them to pursue life changing events or activities.

Through building this project, our team was able to build our individual skills with express js, handlebars, and node js, as well as gain experience in collaboration with full stack developers.
